Status of this project
This project meets the criteria for submission but I'd like to do more work to basically clean up the details before putting in the app store. Mainly it needs finishing touches, like better quality audio clips for the whispering, an enviroment outside the room and better designed menus. I'd also like to integrate the restart menu into the UI, like as a plaque or sign that fits into the environment.

Acheievements
Fundamentals (600 pts)
- Scale: The ceiling falls giving the user a sense of collapse and the room getting smaller. When they first look up, the ceiling is very high, giving the feeling they are very small.
- Animation: The door opens when a correct code is entered.  
- Lighting: There are a few baked lights in the scene. My goal was to make the room feel dark, but still be able to see the most important objects, like the ceiling and the waypoints. The flashlight is currently realtime, which seems to work fine in testing, but if I submitted to App Store I would like refactor the game a bit to remove this. 
- Locomotion: Waypoints to move around.
- Physics: The ceiling uses gravity to fall if the wrong code is entered. I used a collision detector to trigger the sound of the crash when the ceiling hits the pegs.
- Video Player: Old TV will eventually play a clue to help the player find the right code.

Completeness (750)
- Gamification: The experience is an escape room. You must find the clues and enter the right key in order to escape. You will loose once of two ways. 1) wrong code entered too many times or 2) time runs out. 
- Diegetic UI: Resonance audio is used to wisper into the players ears giving them a sense of what they need to do, but otherwise they need to figure out how to escape on their own. Clues are integrated into the environment. 
- 3D Modeling: Created the cone in the corner using blender. 

Challenges (500)
- User Testing (500, I reached 750 in Completeness)
